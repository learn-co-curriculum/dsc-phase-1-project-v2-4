#BOX OFFICE MOVIE ANALYSIS 
Overview
Business Understanding
Most businesses are engaging more in movie production,producing movies of different genres and earn return domestically and worldwide.
Microsoft are keen with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office.
The goal of the project would be to find which movie sales are high and the relationship between genre and the sales and the gross profit for the movies and also the relationship between the return on investment and the genre of movie .
Most business look at the return on investment which is the proportion of initial cash outlay that returns as earnigs from the sale of movies or granting movie rights to studios or theatres worldwide or domestically.
The project will investigate the movies with the highest number of votes to determine the most common movies which most audience prefer and the most profitable which the audience mostly prefers

Data Understanding
The project used data form the imd database in order to acquire information about the movie ratings and movie votes
Information about the production budget was from the tn_movie_budget csv file
The data from the tn_movie_budget contains information about the domestic_gross ,worldwide_gross and obtain information about net_returns
Data from the tn_movie_budget was used to obtain information about the return on investments

Data Analysis
production_budget has a fairly positive correlation with domestic gross.
This shows as more investment is made to the movie the domestic_gross might increase slightly production_budget has a fairly positive correlation with worldwide_gross.
This shows as more investment is made to the movie the worldwide_gross might increase slightly 
production_budget has a weak negative correlation with return_on_investment meaning that the amount of return_on_investment is not affected by the production budget

The movie category with the highest number of votes is the movie which has the following combination of genres:Adventure,Action,SCI-FI 
The second most popular movie category is the Adventure,Animation,Comedy followed by the movie with the genre of biography,drama,history
There is an upward trend in net return when production budget increases 
This shows as more investment is made to the movie the domestic_gross might increase slightly production_budget has a fairly positive correlation with worldwide_gross
This shows as more investment is made to the movie the worldwide_gross might increase slightly production_budget has a weak negative correlation with return_on_investment meaning that the amount of return_on_investment is not affected by the production budget

Conclusion
