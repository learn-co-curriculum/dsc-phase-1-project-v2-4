## Overview
This project analyzes the resource needs of an untitled Microsoft movie company, which wants to jump into the original video content space. Information from the datasets came from movie tracking websites. Descriptive analysis is done to figure what movies should the company make to be successful in the box office.

## Business Problem
Microsoft needs to find the best approach to making movies from the scratch to meet their end goal of conquering the box office. That could entail what kind of people to hire, the projected budgets and what kind of movies to make.

## Data
Data from two different sources were used. Data from the IMDb Database contained information on movie titles, ratings, directors as well as other information. TheNumbers csv included information which were movie titles, production budgets and other information. Both were combined to create a complete dataset.

## Methods
The Analysis uses descriptive analysis which shows the relationship between variable. It shows how some variables are related and could be used to make inferences in data.

## Results





## Conclusions
This analysis leads to three recommendations for the movies that should be created for Microsoft to do well in the original
content space:

- <b>Start with creating movies with the highest rated movie genres</b>. If they start with the top 5 highest rated genres, it would be: Biography, Documentary, History, Sport, and Animation. This may allow consumers of movies to be attracted to the quality of content that the studio produces. It also could lead to critically acclaimed movies that would be featured on prominent movie media outlets as recommendations to watch.

- <b>Choose the highest rated directors per genre.</b> While there are a lot of different directors, some directors specialize in a particular genre. It could affect the movie quality if a director who is highly skilled in producing a horror genre movie directing an animation style movie.

- <b>The highest budget does not always mean higher rated movies.</b> It is better to know how much budget a particular genre spends as to not overexceed budgets too greatly or undercut budgets too harshly. It would be better for the studio to have an estimate to a particular budget and work around that budget accordingly. 

## Next Steps
Further analyses could yield additional insights to growth:
- <b>Better budget projections.</b> This modeling could find the optimal budgets for movie making to maintain consistency in quality.

- <b>Specified combinations in genres.</b> Movies can have multiple genres associated to them so this modeling can explore a combination of genres that might be of interest to the company.

- <b>Budget and ratings.</b> This modeling could be used to make budget/ratings ratio to try to maximize the highest ratings to the lowest average budget.
